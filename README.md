Interactive ChatBot

Overview
This project is a standalone chatbot system trained on intents defined in a JSON file. The chatbot model is trained using a machine learning algorithm and the resulting model is saved in an .h5 file for deployment.

Features
Intent Recognition: Trained model capable of recognizing user intents based on predefined patterns and responses.
Response Generation: Generates appropriate responses to user queries based on the recognized intents.
Training Data Customization: Easily customize training data by modifying the intents JSON file to match specific use cases or domains.
Model Persistence: Trained model is saved in an .h5 file for efficient deployment and reuse.

Customization
Intent Definitions: Customize the intents JSON file (intents.json) to define new intents, patterns, and responses according to specific requirements.
Training Data Expansion: Increase the training data by adding more examples for existing intents or creating new intents for better model performance.
Model Architecture: Experiment with different neural network architectures and parameters to improve model accuracy and efficiency.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the project.
